# PurposefulPluginFusion

Scuffed Fusion360 Plugin to allow users to configure a PP using a basic GUI. This plugin is mostly complete and pretty good (but I'm not going to 
fucking finish it because it makes fucking penises)

Mostly works but it's not going on my portfolio.

## Clone Instructions

### WHY

This is an add-in, so follow basic internet instructions to make a plugin called 'ppFusion'. Make it point to the root folder. Should work (sorry if it doesn't lmao). Then, click on the penis in the Utilites section to run the palette. Configure using the palette to make it. It will spawn at (0, 0).
